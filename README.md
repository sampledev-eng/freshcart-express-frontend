# FreshCart Express Frontend

This is a lightweight demo frontend inspired by online grocery apps. It now includes basic auth screens, profile management, product filters, and order tracking alongside the original catalog and checkout pages.

## Getting Started

Open `src/auth/login.html` to sign in. A demo account is provided (`user@example.com`/`demo`). After logging in you can browse the catalog via `src/index.html`. The page now supports theme switching, language selection (English/Spanish) and a filter sheet with tags. Use the search bar with autocomplete, filters, and sorting to explore items. Ratings and reviews are stored locally.

Checkout is available through `src/checkout.html` where promo codes and delivery slots can be tested. Order status can be viewed from `src/orders.html`. Notifications and offline detection are enabled.

This project remains a minimal prototype and is not production ready but shows how these features could work without a backend.
